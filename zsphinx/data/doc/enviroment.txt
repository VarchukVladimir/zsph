this document describes user environment (custom attributes)
============================================================
(deprecated. user environment will be available via "/dev/nvram" and will not as main() argument) 
 
This design replaces the old one: "ContentType", "TimeStamp", "XObjectMetaTag", "UserETag" -
these keywords were removed from ZeroVM manifest.
 
The new design provides a new manifest keyword: "Environment". The keyword uses a new format:
keyword = value1, value2, value3, value4,.. 

For example:
Environment = TimeStamp, 1337012520, UserETag, 74ebada55, XObjectMetaTag, klaatu_barada_nikto

Will be translated to user environment pairs:
TimeStamp=1337012520
UserETag=74ebada55
XObjectMetaTag=klaatu_barada_nikto

User program can access environment via main() arguments:
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
where "envp" is the array of asciiz strings. It is guaranteed that the last string 
is NULL (just like "argv"). Also the user program can use ZeroVM API to read 
an environment (see "api.txt").

Some environment arguments are meant to be used by ZRT (and/or other libraries). 
For instance "TimeStamp". ZeroVM, however doesn't control it.
